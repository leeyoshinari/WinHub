- Framework: Litestar
- Database: SQLite3 or MySQL
- Front-end: html + js + css

## Deploy
[See the blog for detailed deployment steps](https://blog.ihuster.top/p/940241891.html#%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2) <br>
1.Clone `git clone https://github.com/leeyoshinari/WinHub.git` ;

2.`cd WinHub`, and check configuration in `.env.example`; you must copy it and rename it to `.env`.<br>

3.Install third-party packages
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: If you use Windows system, you need to install pywin32 package, run command: `pip install pywin32`。

4..Install download tool [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases), running `aria2c -v` to verify whether the installation is successful.

5.Startup
```shell script
sh startup.sh
```

6.Configure and start `nginx`, the location configuration is as follows:<br>
(1)Front-end configuration: The front-end file is in `web`, `/Windows` can be modified to any name you like.
```shell script
location /Windows {
    alias /home/WinHub/web/;
    index  index.html;
}
```
(2)Backend request: `proxy_pass` is the IP and port in `config.conf`, `/mycloud` must be the same as `prefix` in `config.conf`.
```shell script
location /mycloud {
     proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:15200;
     proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host;
     proxy_set_header lang $http_lang;
     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
     proxy_set_header Connection $proxy_connection;
     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```
(3) In the `http` module, a mapping need to be add.
```shell
map $http_upgrade $proxy_connection {
    default upgrade;
    "" close;
}
```
（4）Swagger page
```shell
location /api/openapi {
    proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:15200;
}
```

Usually nginx will limit the size of the request body, and you need to add `client_max_body_size 4096M;` to `nginx.conf`. There are other configurations, you can search for information and modify them online by yourself.

If you don’t know nginx, please go to [nginx official website](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) to download nginx and install it. After the installation is completed, replace the installed `nginx.conf` with the `nginx.conf` in this project, and then restart nginx.

7.Create group<br>
Firstly, you need to create a group. All files are stored in groups. One group can have many users, who can view and edit all files under the group. For security, you can only create a group in the API interface documentation, entering the `swagger` page and finding the `/create/group` interface.
```shell script
http://IP:Port/ prefix IN config.conf /schema
```

8.Create user<br>
For security, you can only create a user in the API interface documentation, entering the `swagger` page and finding the `/create/user` interface.
```shell script
http://IP:Port/ prefix IN config.conf /schema
```

9.Page, the url is `http://IP:Port/Windows` (the IP and port are the IP and port set in Nginx. `Windows` is the name of the front-end configuration in step 8)

## Others
1.Supports multiple platforms such as `Linux`, `Windows`, `MacOS`, etc. It is recommended to deploy on `Linux`.

2.Cluster deployment and distributed storage are not supported.

3.Playing videos online uses streaming playback, which requires that the metadata of the video must be at the front of the video file. So, you need to manually move the metadata of the video to the front of the video file. Using the [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) to move the metadata of the video. The command: `ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -map_metadata 0 -c:v copy -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_video.mp4`.

4.Whether you are using a PC browser or a mobile browser, setting the browser to display in full screen will provide a better user experience.
